# Why Rarog

Rarog is a CSS framework that tries to give you:

- **Design tokens first** — colors, spacing, radii, shadows, typography.
- **Utility-first ergonomics** — Tailwind-style classes for 80–90% of layouts.
- **Batteries-included components** — buttons, forms, navigation, layout, JS widgets.
- **Own JS core** — dropdown, modal, offcanvas, carousel, stepper and more, all in vanilla JS.
- **JIT / build modes** — full build for prototyping, JIT for production.

Rarog aims to feel like:

> “Tailwind for utilities” + “Bootstrap for components & JS” + “Design system
> ready out-of-the-box”.

It is also optimized for the **Cajeer** ecosystem, but stays generic enough to be
used in any PHP/JS stack.

## When to choose Rarog

- You want a **token-based** design system, not just a CSS reset.
- You like **utility-first** workflow, but still want components and JS.
- You plan to build a product with **clear theming** and **multi-branding**.
- You want a framework that is **open-source** and evolves in the open.


## UI kits and templates

Starting from 2.9.0, Rarog ships not only as a framework but also with
ready‑made UI kits:

- **Rarog UI Admin** — admin dashboard;
- **Rarog Landing Kit** — landing page sections;
- **Rarog SaaS Starter** — auth/dashboard/settings/billing layout.

These help you:

- show Rarog “in action” to your team or stakeholders;
- copy layouts into Laravel/React/Next.js/Cajeer projects;
- treat Rarog as part of a full design system, not just a CSS layer.
