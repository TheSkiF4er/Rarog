# Components (overview)

This page lists the main Rarog components and links to detailed docs:

- Buttons, badges, alerts.
- Navbars, tabs, dropdowns.
- Modals, offcanvas, toasts, tooltips/popovers.
- Grid & layout helpers.
- Advanced components: carousel, stepper, data-heavy patterns.

Use the Russian docs as a more narrative reference if needed — the goal
for EN is to keep the API surface clear and discoverable.
