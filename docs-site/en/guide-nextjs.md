How to plug Rarog into a Next.js app:

- add `rarog-css` as a dependency;
- import base CSS in `_app` or root layout;
- configure `rarog.config.*` to scan `app/` or `pages/` directories;
- run `rarog build` as part of your Next.js build.

UI kits such as Admin/Landing/SaaS can be migrated into React/Next.js
components with minimal changes.
